# CSC2274 Week 7 : Animate SUPER YOU!

In this assignment, you are to animate the two top images in your SUPER YOU assignment.

## Requirements:

 * You must do this using JavaScript.
 * Animations will be done using the `setIterval` timer in JavaScript.
 * `setInterval`  will call a JavaScript function called `animateMe`.
 * `animateMe` will be defined in the file **script.js**.
 * The "normal you" image should have one animation and the "super you" image should have a different animation.
 * Your first step should be to copy your HTML and CSS files from the Super You assignment.
